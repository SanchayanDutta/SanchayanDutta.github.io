Iâ€™m a graduate student interested in the mathematical foundations of quantum computing and quantum information theory. My advisor is [Greg Kuperberg](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~greg/).

Previously, I was a student at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University, India (2017-2021).
